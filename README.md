# ops-201d2-challenge

This Repo is a collection of scripts written during my time in Code Fellows Ops 201d2 course. As someone who didn't have a background in tech before Code Fellows, these scripts are me doing my best to learn how to do script coding. Coding and Ops are becoming more intertwined and automation scripting is incredibly useful. Being able to set something up once and let it go whenever you need it is a wonderful time saving. I'm learning the fundamentals of IT, networking and security during my time in Ops 201. 
 
My favorite assignment so far in Ops was rooting out malware and viruses from our lab vm, followed by boosting it's defenses. The two scripts that would be helpful in a workplace would be the mkdir and the loop. My lshwcopy script is one I hope to improve in the near future. It needs refinement on it's search function. I hope to hone in my skills with scripting to write more robust and refined scripts.
